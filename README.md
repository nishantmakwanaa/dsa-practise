# Data Structures And Algorithms In Java

This Repository Provides An Organized And Modular Implementation Of Data Structures And Algorithms (DSA) In Java. Each Topic Is Covered In A Dedicated File, Making It Easy To Navigate, Learn, And Apply These Concepts. The Project Is Structured To Allow A `Main.java` File To Call Different Implementations As Needed.

## Why Is This Repository Useful For Students?

- **Comprehensive DSA Coverage**: Covers Commonly Used Data Structures And Algorithms With Clean And Modular Code.
- **Easy Navigation**: Each Data Structure Or Algorithm Has Its Own File For Better Organization And Understanding.
- **Reusability**: Designed For Students Preparing For Coding Interviews, Competitive Programming, And Academic Projects.
- **Practical Examples**: Demonstrates How To Use Each Data Structure Or Algorithm Through The `Main.java` File.
- **Real-World Applications**: Includes Examples Of How DSA Concepts Are Applied To Solve Real-World Problems.

## Features

- **Organized Codebase**: Each File In The `src/` Folder Corresponds To A Specific Topic.
- **Reusable Classes**: Modular Implementation Allows Easy Integration Into Other Projects.
- **Practical Demonstrations**: `Main.java` Acts As The Entry Point To Call Different DSA Implementations.
- **Well-Documented Code**: Each File Includes Comments To Explain Its Purpose And Logic.
